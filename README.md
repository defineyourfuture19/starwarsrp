Please read: Hello, my name is 3xcellentTuber(Ethan), 1 mounth ago I STOPPED developing this gamemode and the GMod server, This gamemode is a very well developed one, an imperial swrp(the most popular one) and you will be able to set this up pretty quickly on your server if you have worked with such files before. Please notice, this gamemode needs to work with the addons I provide here, you will need to create a garry's mod collection and add all of the addons that are on my collection http://goo.gl/fI18Ma to yours. all of the copy rights belong to me and to my server's community, and you may not call it yours even after you made changes, due to this gamemode being written by FPtje, and overwritten by me. By you downloading this and using this project, you agree to the fact that the base code is FPtje's and that the overwritten one(darkrp mod') is mine. You are allowed to make changes(Localy).

This project is for people that already have thier server configured and ready to go. I will be supporting this project, if there are any errors with the code that I had written, I will check it, you may contact me over my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/3xcellenttuberen I will not be fixing YOUR errors, if you created any changes over my code or FPtje's I do not guarantee that I will fix it for you.
